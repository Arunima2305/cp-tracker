## 🛠️ Setup Instructions


###  Backend

You can run the backend either locally or inside a Docker container (recommended for Puppeteer scraping support).

### 🔧 Option 1: Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arunima2305/codeflow-backend.git
cd codeflow-backend
npm install
npm start
```

✅ Make sure you have the following in your `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_url
```

**Note:** If you are using Puppeteer locally (for Codeforces scraping), make sure Google Chrome is installed or Puppeteer can find Chromium. Otherwise, use Docker (see below).

---

### 🐳 Option 2: Run with Docker (Recommended for Puppeteer)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arunima2305/cp-tracker
cd backend
docker build -t backend .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env backend
```

This setup ensures Puppeteer runs headless Chrome properly, which is required for Codeforces scraping.




### Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arunima2305/cp-tracker
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build # or npm start for dev
```

### Chrome Extension (Local)

* Go to `chrome://extensions`
* Enable Developer Mode
* Click "Load Unpacked" and select the `extension/` folder
